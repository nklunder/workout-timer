Based on [The World's Best Pushup Exercises](http://www.menshealth.com/deltafit/worlds-best-pushup-workouts) article on the Men's Health website.

> Grab a stopwatch and try this routine. It’s designed to quickly improve your upper-body endurance. Time how long it takes you do as many pushups as you can. Then rest for the same time period, and repeat the process two to four times. So if you do 20 pushups in 25 seconds, you’ll rest 25 seconds, and repeat. Let’s say on your next round you complete 12 pushups in 16 seconds. You’d then rest for 16 seconds before your next set. You can apply this technique to any variation of the exercise you want.
